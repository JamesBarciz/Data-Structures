Runtime Complexity:

    - What is it?

    - What's the point of it?
        - Compare arbitraty algorithms, functions, pieces of code

BigO Classifications: (input_size, #_operations)
    - O(c) - Constant time
    - O(log_n) - Logarithmic time
        - # elements increases num operations is constant
    - O(n) - Linear time
        - # elements increases, # operations increase linearly
    - O(n*log_n) - Log-linear time
    - O(n^c) - Quadratic time
    - O(c^n) - Exponential time
    - O(n!) - Factorial time
